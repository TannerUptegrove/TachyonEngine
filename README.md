# Tachyon Engine
A scrolling ping pong game in C++.
<br>

## Premise
Humanity has unlocked the potential of tachyons, allowing us to go faster than light. However, your ship has become the first to have an engine malfunction - from now on it'll have to be powered it up manually. As the best ping pong player on the ship though, this shouldn't be too difficult.

- Item descriptions (unlocks after certain scores are met).
